        "In this project, we will delve into the practical application of algorithms by building a spam filter for SMS messages. The aim of this project is to train a computer to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam with an accuracy greater than 80%. This will be done by:\n",
        "- leveraging human knowledge of how messages are classified\n",
        "- using the information above to estimate the probability of a new message being either spam or non-spam. \n",
        "- having the computer classify messages as either spam or non-spam based on the probability values.\n",

        "To achieve this, we will use the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm along with a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that have already been classified by humans. Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo compiled the [dataset](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/433/SMSSpamCollection), which is available for download from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).\n",
